Jn 1:...

In the beginning was the word
and the word was with God
and the wrod was God
He was with God in the beggining

Through Him all things were made
without Him nothing was made that has been made
In Him was life
and that life was the light to all mankind
the Light shines in the drakness
and the darkness has not overcome it

The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world
He was in the wrold
and though the world was made through Him
the world did not recognize Him
He came to that which was His own
but His own did not receive Him
Yet, to all who did receive Him
to those who believed in His Name
He gave the right to become children of God
children born not of natural descent
nor human decision
nor husband's will
but born of God

The word became flesh and made His dwelling among us
we have seen His glory
the glory of the one and only son
who came form the Father
full of grace and truth
Out of His fullness
we have all received Grace in place of Grace already given
for the Law was given thru Moses
Grace and Truth came thru Jesus Christ



Ps 1
Blessed is the one who
does not walk in step with the wicked
or stand in the way sinners take
nor sit in the company of mockers
but whose delight is in the Law of the Lord
and who meditates on His Law day and night.
That person is like a tree planted by streams of water
which yields its fruit in season
and whose leaf never whithers
everything they do propsers
Not so the wicked
they are like chaff that the wind blows away
therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgement
nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous
for the Lord watches over the step of the rightoeus
but the path of the wicked leads to desctruction.

Ps 23 {
  The Lord is my shepherd I shall not wan 
  He makes me lie down in green pastures
  He leads me by still waters
  He restores my soul
  He leads me in the path of righteousness for His name sake
  
  Ye even tho I walk thru the valley of the shadow of deat I will fear no evil
  for you are with me
  Your rod and your staff will comfort me
  
  You prepare a table before me
  In the presence of my enemies
  You anoint my head with oil
  My cup overthflows
  
  Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life
  and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
}

Ps 25{
  In you lord i put my trust
  I trut in you

  Do not let me be put to shame
  nor let my enemies triumph over me
  No one who hopes in you will ever be put to shame
  but shame will come on those who are treacherous without a cause

  Show me Your ways Lord
  teach me Your paths
  Guide me in Your truth and teach me
  For You are God my saviour
  and my hope is in You all day long
  
  Remember Lord Your great mercy and love
  for they are from of old
  Do not remember the sins of my youth and my rebeliious ways
  according to Your love remember me
  for You Lord are good.

  Good and upright is the Lord
  therefore He instructs sinners in His ways
  He guides the Humble in what is right
  and teaches them His way
  All the ways of the Lord are loving and faithful
  towards those who keep the demands of His covenant
  For the sake of your name Lord
  forgive my inquity, though it is great.

  Who then are those who feear the Lord ?
  He will instruct them in the ways they should choose
  they will spend their dayss in prosperity
  and their descendants will inehrit the land
  the Lord confides in thsoe who trust in Him
  He makes His covenant known to them
  My eyes are ever on the Lord
  for only He will release my feet from the snare.

  Turn to me and be gracious to me
  for I am lonely and afflicted
  Relieve the troubles of my heart
  and free me from my anguish
  Look at my afflictions and my distress
  and take away all my sins
  See how numerous are my enemies
  and how fiercely they hate me

  Guard my life and recue me
  do not let me be put to shame
  for I take refuge in You
  MMay integrity and uprightness protect me
  because my hope Lord is in You

  Deliver ISrael o God
  from all their troubles.

  Guard my life and rescue me
  do not let me be put to shame
  for I take refuge in You
  May integrity and uprightness protct me
  because my hope Lord is in You
}

Ps 34 {
  I extol the Lord all the time
  His praise will always be on my lips
  I glory in the fLord forever
  Let the afflicted hear and rejoice
  Glorify the Lord with me
  Let us exalt His name together

  I sought the Lord and he answered me
  He delivered me from all my fears
  Those who look on Him are radiant
  their faces are never covered in shame
  THis poor man called
  and the Lord heard him
  He saved him out of all his troubles
  The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him
  and He delivers them

  Taste and see that the Lord is good
  blessed is te one who takes reguhe in Him
  Fear the Lord all you Hisholy people
  for those who fear Him lack nothing
  the lion may grow weak and weary
  but htose who trust in the Lord 
  lack no good thing
  Come my children
  Listen to me
  I will teach you the fear of the Lord
  Whoever of you loves life 
  and desires to see many good days
  keep your tongue from evil
  and your lips from telling lies
  Turn from evil and do good
  Seek peace and pursuit.

  The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous
  and His ear is attentive to their cry
  but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil
  to blot out their names from the earth

  The righteous cry out and the Lord hears them
  He delivers them from all their torubles
  The Lord is close to the brokenhearted
  and saves those who are crushed in SPiritl.

  The righteous person has many troubles
  but the Lord delivers Him from them all
  He protects all His bones
  not one of them will be broken

  Evil will slay the wicked
  the foes of the righteous will be condemned
  the Lord will rescue His servants
  no one who takes refuge in Him will be condemned.
