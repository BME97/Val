ps 32{
Blessed is the one
whose transgressions are forgiven
whose sins are covered
Blessed is the one
whose sin the Lord does not ocunt against them
and in whose spirit is no deceit

When i Kept silent
my bones wasted away
through my groaning all day long
For day and night
Your hand was heaevy on me
my strength was sapped
as in the heat of the summer.

Then I acknowledged my sin to You
and did not cover up my iniquity.
I said "I will confess
my transgressions to the Lord"
And You forgave
the guilt of my sin.

Therefore let all the faithful pray to You
while You may be found;
surely the rising of the mighty waters
will not reach them
You are my hiding place;
You will protect me from toruble
and surround me with songs of deliverance

I will isntruct You and teach You in the way you should go;
I will counsel You with my loving eye on You.
Do not be like the horse or the mule
which have no understanding
but must be controlled by bit and bridle
or they will not come to you.
Many are the woes of the wicked,
but the Lord's unfailing love
surrounds the one who trusts in Him.

Rejoice in the Lord and beglad, you righteous;
sing, all you who are upright in heart!
